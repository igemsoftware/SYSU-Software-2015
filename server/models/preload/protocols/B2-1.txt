2-1 Overnight Cultures with Antibiotics
Introduction
Setting up an overnight culture of a single bacterial strain needs a plate with single colonies and LB containing the appropriate antibiotic. Antibiotics should not be added to LB before autoclaving the LB or after subsequent cooling to room temperature for storage because antibiotics are not sufficiently stable. Antibiotic solutions are stored pure at −15°C and only added just before the addition of bacteria.
Components
Normal working concentrations are:
Ampicillin: 35 μg/mL;
Chloramphenicol: 35 μg/mL;
Kanamycin: 35μg/mL.
Normal stock concentrations:
1000-fold higher than above, respectively.
Note: Chloramphenicol stock is dissolved in ethanol.
Procedure	Time	Notes
1. Quickly burn the neck of a bottle containing LB medium before pouring it out into a flask (or tube).	3s/tube	Burning prevents contaminative growth in LB medium. Even the slightest contamination of LB will be visible the next day as an unwelcome culture!
2. Add the antibiotic to give the appropriate concentration listed above.	20s/tube	Antibiotics are used for preventing contaminative growth and selecting certain bacteria.
3. Scoop one colony from the plate with a sterile inoculation loop (or micropipette tip).	5s/tube	
4. Immediately stick the loop (or tip) into the flask (or tube) containing the medium and antibiotic for a few seconds.	5s/tube	
5. Cover the flask loosely with aluminum foil (or cap tube loosely) by taping it on to allow exchange of oxygen.	10s/tube	Good oxygenation is required not only for maximal growth, but also for chemical maturation of the chromoprotein chromophores.
6. Incubate at 37°C with shaking overnight.	12hr	Generally speaking, bacteria proliferate at maximal rate at 37°C. In 12 hours the density of bacteria reaches a proper value.
