1-3 1 M CaCl2
Introduction
CaCl2 is used in a less concentrated form for making competent E. coli cells. Upon exposure to CaCl2, the cell wall becomes fragile and at 42Â°C E. coli takes up foreign plasmids efficiently.
Components
CaCl2;
ddH2O.
Procedure	Time	Notes
1. Look up the molecular weight of CaCl2.	10s	Molecular weight is the weight(g) of 1mol a certain substance.
2. Calculate how much CaCl2 you need to weigh to give 10 mL of 1 M CaCl2 solution.	30s	Every 10ml solution contains 1M CaCl2. The weight of CaCl2 can be calculated from the molecular weight in step 1.
3. Weigh out the powder and add it to 8 ml water.	20s	Solids should always be dissolved in a smaller volume of ddH2O than the final calculated volume.
4. Stir and shake until it dissolves.	10s	
5. Make up to 10 mL final volume.		
6. Autoclave for 20 min.	20min	Autoclaving prevents contaminative growth.
