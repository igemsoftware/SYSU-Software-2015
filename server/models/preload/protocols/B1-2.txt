1-2 50% (v/v) Glycerol, 50 mL
Introduction
This solution is to be used for making cell glycerol stocks of important bacterial strains.
Components
Glycerol stock;
ddH2O.
Procedure	Time	Notes
1. Check which percentage glycerol is in the stock.	20s	
2. Calculate how much volume you need of glycerol and how much water you need to add to reach a final volume of 50 mL.	30s	Every 50ml solution contains 25ml glycerol.
3. Measure the glycerol in a measuring cylinder.	20s	
4. Add to a glass bottle and add water to make a 50% glycerol solution.	10s	
5. Autoclave for 20 min.	20min	Autoclaving prevents contaminative growth.
