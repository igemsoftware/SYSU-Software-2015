1-5 SOB Medium
Introduction
SOB medium, or Super Optimal Broth, is used for preparing chemically competent cells. This protocol is adapted from Ausubel et al. (1999).
Components
Yeast extract;
Tryptone;
NaCl;
KCl;
ddH2O;
5 M NaOH.
Procedure	Time	Notes
1.Add the following to a 1 L bottle:
0.5% (w/v) yeast extract.
2% (w/v) tryptone.
NaCl to a final concentration of 10 mM.
KCl to a final concentration of 2.5 mM.	5min	Tryptone and yeast extract are nutrients for bacterial culture media. NaCl and KCl provide potassium ions and sodium ions.
2. Add ddH2O up to 600 mL.	45s	
3. Adjust the pH with 120Î¼L 5 M NaOH.	2min	pH should be adjusted to an appropriate range for bacteria growth or metabolite accumulation.
4. Autoclave for 20 min within 2 hr.	20min	Autoclaving in time prevents contaminative growth.
5. Store at room temperature.
