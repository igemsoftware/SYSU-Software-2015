2 BIOBRICK™ 3A ASSEMBLY AND GEL ANALYSIS
True
Introduction
The starting point of every 3A assembly is plasmid DNA preps of three different BioBricks. The endpoint is, hopefully, colored bacterial colonies.
Components
DNA plasmids;
ddH2O;
10x reaction buffer for restriction enzymes provided by manufacturer;
EcoRI restriction endonuclease, heat-inactivatable;
XbaI restriction endonuclease, heat-inactivatable;
SpeI restriction endonuclease, heat-inactivatable;
PstI restriction endonuclease, heat-inactivatable;
T4 DNA ligase;
10x reaction buffer for T4 DNA ligase provided by manufacturer;
papers of every different color, as well as black, grey and white.
