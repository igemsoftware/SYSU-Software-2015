6 AGAROSE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS
True
Introduction
Agarose gel electrophoresis is used for separation and analysis of larger (100 bases in length) nucleic acids under non-denaturing conditions. 
By adding the sample with loading buffer to the gel wells and applying a current over the anode and cathode, the negatively charged nucleic acid will migrate to the positive electrode. Analysis requires that the gel contains a DNA stain visible under UV light. 
Notice：
Since the stain interacts with nucleic acids and is therefore potentially mutagenic, always wear nitrile gloves when working with agarose gels. If the stain is ethidium bromide, not Sybr®Safe, make sure that contaminated waste (pipette tips, gels, etc.) is disposed of in hazardous waste boxes. Use protective glasses when using the UV light box.
