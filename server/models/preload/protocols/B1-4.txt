1-4 10x TBE Buffer
Introduction
TBE stands for the three components Tris, boric acid and EDTA. EDTA chelates Mg2+, both inhibiting enzymatic degradation of nucleic acid and giving sharper bands on gels. There is no risk of contaminative growth in 10x stock solution, but over time the salt may precipitate, requiring preparation of fresh buffer. The concentration in the gel and running buffer should always be 1x TBE.
Components
Tris base;
Boric acid;
EDTA;
ddH2O.
Procedure	Time	Notes
1. Dissolve the following reagents in 400 ml ddH2O using a magnetic stirrer:
Tris to a final concentration of 0.89 M;
boric acid to a final concentration of 0.89 M.	5min	
2. Dissolve Na2EDTA or   Na4EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mM.	2min	Na2EDTA or Na4EDTA can be used since their different effects on pH can be neglected for this buffer. EDTA chelates Mg2+, both inhibiting enzymatic degradation of nucleic acid and giving sharper bands on gels.
3. Adjust the volume to 0.5 L. The pH will be ~8.5.	20s	
4. Store at room temperature.		Over time the salt may precipitate.
