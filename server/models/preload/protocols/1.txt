1 PREPARATION OF COMPETENT E. coli CELLS USING CaCl2
True
Introduction
E. coli is inefficient at taking up foreign plasmids. One cannot rely on its natural competence (ability to take up foreign DNA). For increasing the competence, the cell wall is made permeable by treatment with CaCl2. It is important that the whole process is kept chilled! Remember to be careful with the cells as they become very fragile. E. coil DH5 is strongly recommended because of high competence and low ability to degrade foreign DNA by restriction at unmethylated sites.
Components
SOB medium;
Plate with single cell colonies;
0.1 M CaCl2, ice-cold;
0.1 M CaCl2 with 20% glycerol, ice-cold;
Liquid nitrogen.
Procedure
1. Take one colony and start a 5 mL overnight culture at 37°C, with shaking.	12hr	
2. Dilute the overnight culture 1:100 into 50 mL SOB medium.	20s	
3. Grow culture at 37°C with shaking to an OD600 0.4.	5hr	
4. Let the culture sit on ice for 15 min, swirling occasionally.	15min	When the cells are properly chilled, proceed to the next step.
5. Pour the culture into a 50 mL Falcon™ tube.	10s	
6. Centrifuge at 3500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C.	5min	Centrifugation separates bacteria from liquid culture.
7. Remove as much as possible of the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.	15s	
8. Resuspend the pellet in 100L ice-cold 0.1 M CaCl2 with the help of a sterilized loop.	30s	CaCl2 treatment promotes the entrance of foreign DNA fragments by making cell wall permeable.
9. Add 15 mL ice-cold 0.1 M CaCl2. Mix gently by pipetting up and down a few times.	20s	Cells are extremely fragile. Do not vortex!
10. Incubate the cells on ice for 30 min.	30min	
11. Pellet the cells again at 3500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C.	5min	
12. Resuspend the cells in 2 mL ice-cold 0.1M CaCl2/20% glycerol.	30s	CaCl2 treatment makes cell wall permeable.
13. Incubate for 45 min on ice.	45min	
14. Aliquot carefully in 50L amounts to chilled 1.5 mL tubes.	5min	Different tubes should be thawed separately when using because repeatedly freezing and thawing is harmful to cells.
15. Snap freeze in liquid nitrogen any tubes that will not be used for transformation within a few hours.		
16. Store at −80°C.
