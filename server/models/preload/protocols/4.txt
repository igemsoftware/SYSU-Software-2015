4 BACTERIAL RE-STREAKING TECHNIQUES
True
Introduction 
To obtain a clonal which is guaranteed to be resistant to the antibiotic.(e.g. if they sit next to a colony secreting the ampicillin resistance enzyme).
Components
Agar plates

 


=======
4 COLONY PCR
Introduction 
To prepare DNA samples from several colonies to screen for the desired mutant by sequencing. There is no need for a cell lysis step because the DNA template is released from the bacterial colony during a PCR reaction.
Components
A plate with re-streaked, single colonies;
ddH2O;
dNTPs, 2 mM;
VF2 primer;
VR primer;
10x Taq PCR buffer provided by manufacturer;
Taq DNA polymerase.

Procedure	Time	Notes
1. Calculate the extension time in your lab note book:
Length of amplicon: ________ kb.
Taq extension time per kb: 1 min/kb.
Extension time (length × extension time per kb):
________ hh:mm:ss.
	1min	
2. Fill in the extension time in the program grid:
Temperature Time (hh:mm:ss) Number of cycles
94°	00:05:00	 1x
94°	 00:00:30
	30x

58°	00:00:30	
72°		
72°	 00:07:00	1x
4° 	∞	 1x
	30s	
3. Program the PCR machine (unless an identical program already exists in the machine).	2min	
4. Number the colonies you wish to test by marking on the backs of test and control plates.	1min/per plate	
5. Using a sterile loop, pick a small portion of each of these colonies and suspend individually in 30 μL of water. Mix thoroughly.	30s/per colony	
6.Calculate the volumes for making up your pre-mix
for several reactions (as described above) based on
the volumes provided for just one reaction here:
ddH2O 28.7 μL
10x Taq PCR buffer 5 μL
2 mM dNTPs 5 μL
VF2 (5 μM) 5 μL
VR (5 μM) 5 μL
Taq DNA polymerase 0.3 μL
Total reaction mix 49 μL		
7. Prepare your pre-mix and divide into 49 μL aliquots on ice.		
8. Add 1 μL of each cell suspension to each aliquot and mix.		
9. Run the PCR reactions.		
10. Analyze a 5 μL aliquot of each PCR by agarose gel electrophoresis.
