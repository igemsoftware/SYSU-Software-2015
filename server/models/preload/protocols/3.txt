3 TRANSFORMATION OF CaCl2-COMPETENT E. coli CELLS
True
Introduction
Remember that competent cells are very fragile and should only be mixed gently. Transformation plating results, like most results, can be very difficult to interpret without positive and negative controls. A good way to plan controls is to think how you might interpret different kinds of possible results. For example, are colonies really due to correct clones, or are they due to contaminating cells (due to degradation of the antibiotic plates stored for too long), contaminating plasmids or uncut vector? Is a lack of colonies due to failed ligations or just poor competent cells? 
Components
CaCl2-competent E. coli cells;
SOB media;
DNA plasmid.
Agar plates
Control 
1. Water (a negative control)
2. Unligated, cut plasmid(s) (a negative control).
3. Intact plasmid (a positive control). This transforms much more efficiently than ligated plasmid, so 0.1 and 10 ng is sufficient
Procedure
1. Turn on a water bath or heating block to 42°C.	5s	
2. Thaw competent cells on ice for 15 min.	15min	Unfreeze the competent cells on ice
3. Add 5 L of ligation reaction mixture or controls above to 50 L of competent cells.	10s	
4. Incubate for 30 min on ice.	30min	Allow the DNA plasmid to attach to the surface of the competent cells
5. Heat shock for 45 s at 42°C.	45s	Ice treatment and heat shock promote the entrance of foreign DNA fragments
6. Incubate for 5 min on ice.	5min	To shrink the holes on the competent cells’ membrane
7. Add 950 L of SOB media (pre-heated to 37°C).	10s	Provide nutrition for them to grow.  
8. Incubate for 1–1.5 hr at 37°C, with occasional gentle mixing by inversion of the tubes.	1.5hr	Bacteria recover in SOB media.
9. For positive controls, mix gently and plate 100 L only (1/10th) on an agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotic as in Step 12.	2min	
10. Spin cells down from remaining 900 L at 4000 rpm for 5 min.	5min	Centrifugation separates bacteria from liquid culture.
11. Discard all but 100 L of the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in the remaining 100L.	30s/per tube	
12. Spread the remaining suspension on an agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotic as follows:
(i) Dip the spreader into 95% ethanol.
(ii) Put it into the flame for a second.
(iii) Let the ethanol burn off outside the flame.
(iv) Spread the bacterial suspension evenly out on an agar plate. Continue until all the inoculum has gone into the agar.
(v) Put the plates at 37C overnight.	2min/per plate;
12-14hr	Ethanol treatment and burning prevents contaminative growth.
13.Day 2: Calculate transformation efficiency (colonies/g) of the competent cells using the positive control plates. In the evening, re-streak appropriate colonies (Protocol 7).	45min	
14. Day 3: Set overnight cultures.	12hr	One night is needed for a single cell to grow into a colony.
15. Day 4: Make glycerol cell stocks of strains worth saving and process the rest of the culture according to instructions.	5min	Glycerol protects bacteria against low temperature.
