In this circuit, bacteria will stop walking in the region with high concentration of theophylline, in which way bacteria will finally get together to this region.
Under the control of theophylline, the engineered bacteria with green fluorescence will move toward the infection site with a high concentration of theophylline and the expression of Lysis becomes more and more, while the engineered bacteria with red fluorescence will stay at the original site and wait to creat the second wave of the engineered bacteria with green fluorescence. They have been protected from being destroyed by the pyosin from the engineered bacteria with green fluorescence. The engineered bacteria with green fluorescence will destroy themselves and release the Pyosin, which is expressed at the beginning of the process, to kill the pathogens.
