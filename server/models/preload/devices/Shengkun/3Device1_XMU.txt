Kill switch 2011XMU-China
The device is designed to build a programmed bacterial death circuit, which is based on the quorum sensing system. 
The LuxI protein synthesizes a small, diffusible acyl-homoserinelactone (AHL) signaling molecule. The AHL accumulates as the cell density increases. At sufficiently high concentrations, it binds the LuxR, which induces the expression of the killer gene ccdB under the control of a promoter luxpR.
