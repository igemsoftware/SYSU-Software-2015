This device responds to IP and expresses the Arabidopsis CRE1 cytokinin receptor.
Upon binding inducer, CRE1 phosphorylates the histidine phosphor-transfer protein YPD1. In yeast, YPD1 is normally affected by the cell surface osmosensor histidine kinase SLN1. Under normal conditions, SLN1 is constitutively phosphorylated and its kinase activity maintains YPD1 in its phosphorylated state. YPD1 in turn regulates two parallel pathways by transferring its phosphate to two proteins: SSK1 and SKN7. SSK1 phosphorylation is key to suppressing the yeast¡¯s HOG1 pathway ¨C a stress reponse pathway to high osmolarity, whose activity is lethal under normal conditions. YPD1 also shuttles into the nucleus and activates the SKN7 transcription factor by phosphorylation. In the design, SKN7 was preferred over SSK1 because the SLN1-YPD1-SSK1 pathway is known to affect many high-osmolarity response genes. In order to make SKN7 inducible to IP stimulation (i.e. not constitutively phosphorylated), SLN1 had to be deleted; however, SLN1 deletion is lethal due to activation of the HOG1 pathway.
