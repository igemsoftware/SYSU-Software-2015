Toggle switch 2011USTC
A toggle switch with two stable states - CI and CI434 and the orginal state can be either of the two.
CI repressor is expressed after a CI434 repressible promoter, while the CI434 is expressed after a CI repressible promoter. LuxpR (BBa_R0062) controls the expression of cI repressor which would influence the ratio of toggle switch.
