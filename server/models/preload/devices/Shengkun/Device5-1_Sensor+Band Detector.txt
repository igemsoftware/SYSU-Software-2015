LacIM1 (Bba_K625000) is a LacI variant with the same protein sequence as the wild-type LacI, but with a completely codon-modified DNA sequence. This enables to use both sequences on two different plasmids (with two different promoters) without recombination happening between them. This feature can be used to establish a bandpass filter.
