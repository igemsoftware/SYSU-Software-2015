This biosensor has feedback between two parts when each affects the others. In this system, these two parts are the light sensor and the concentration of the light generator protein. By involving the light sensor in the loop, we can establish the feedback.
Light sensor: The Lux operon is a set of genes active in bacterial luminescence. The genes encoding the luciferase and a fatty acid reductase complex which synthesizes the substrate are contained in a single operon. When cloned into a recipient host, the lux operon facilitates the generation of a blue-green light with a maximum intensity at 490 nm without the requirement of adding exogenous substrate, which was the prime reason why we chose it to be our light source in this study. Light generator: This generator use BBa_K238013, an exact promoter of the blue light receptor, is a portion of an E.coli constitutive light sensing system. This system consists of a receptor, ycgF, which is responsive to blue light. When blue light strikes, the When blue light strikes, the receptor changes conformation and dimerizes driven by the BLUF-domain. This allows it to bind to the ycgE repressor through its EAL-domain, releasing the repressor from the promoter region. In summary, the irradiance of blue light will cause a positive induction, expression downstream Light sensing feedback using ycgF-YcgE-YcgZ sensing system.
