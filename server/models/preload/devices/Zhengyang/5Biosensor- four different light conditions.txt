Biosensor-four different light conditions 2012ETH_Zurich
This is a biological circuit which can distinguish between four different light conditions light (~16%). In our model, strong irradiance with blue light as well as red light serves as an indicator for sun light. The other states of our decoder filter out common light sources.
i) high red-high blue; ii) high red-low blue; iii) low red-high blue and iv) low red-low blue (Fig. 5). Such circuit consists of three hybrid promoters each acting as a NOR gate for two different transcriptional repressors i.e. transcription from such promoter is activated just when both repressors are absent.
