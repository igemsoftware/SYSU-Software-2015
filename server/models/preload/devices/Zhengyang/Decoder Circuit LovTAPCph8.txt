¡¾2¡¿	This circuit consists of well-characterised photoreceptors and transcriptional repressors that have been previously shown to work in-vivo, providing a practical alternative to the UVR8-TetRDBD-based system. Although LovTAP mainly acts as a blue-light photoreceptor, a minority of induced reactions are still caused by UV light (~16%). In our model, strong irradiance with blue light as well as red light serves as an indicator for sun light. The other states of our decoder filter out common light sources.
