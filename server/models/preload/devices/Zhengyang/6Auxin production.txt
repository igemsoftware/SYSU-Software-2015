Auxin production 2012Evry
Two genes involved in the auxin biosynthesis pathway, namely iaaM and iaaH, will be expressed in a constitutive and ubiquitous manner in a first step and in a second step in an inducible and tissue-specific manner. 
The iaaM gene encodes tryptophan-2-monooxygenase (IAAM) that catalyses the conversion of tryptophan (Trp) into indole-3-acetamide (IAM). The iaaH gene encodes indoleacetamide hydrolase (IAAH) that hydrolyse IAM to release indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) . At the same time, the synthesized IAM and IAA will competitively inhibit the enzyme activity of IAAM. Produced auxin will then diffuse through the plasma membrane into the extracellular medium and finally into the blood.
