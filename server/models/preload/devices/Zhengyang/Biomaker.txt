Purdue-2012-1
¡¾1¡¿	Our circuit focuses on improving and appending a pre-existing construct as well as constructing a novel construct to create a feed-back loop that is capable of preventing the cell from overtaxing itself in production of adhesion protein and surface-positiong silicatein alpha protein. The following image demonstrates the basic schematic of the circuit.
