¡¾1¡¿	UVR8 (UV Resistance Locus 8) acts as a UVB photoreceptor in plants. It regulates the transcription factor COP and indirectly affects the expression of a myriad of genes. However, we employ it differently, as described here. In the following, we analyse the theoretical requirements for our system that employs UVR8's dimerisation ability to work. It involves some manual parameter optimisation in order to determine the optimal concentration regimes for the receptors and enzymes in the cell.
