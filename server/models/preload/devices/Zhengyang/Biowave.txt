¡¾1¡¿	The biowave system is made by two parts: the light generator and the light sensor. When the light, which generated by the light generator, is strong enough that could be sensed by the light sensor. The sensor protein could repress the expression of light generator. This signal pathway, which based on light, makes the negative feedback. And the expression of light generator makes the time delay.In a single cell the system is a oscillator, within the colony it will perform a synchronization. This is the very first time that bacteria using light as an intercellular and intracellular signal in synthetic biology. The wave pattern or the synchronized oscillation could help us explain a lot of biological problems.
