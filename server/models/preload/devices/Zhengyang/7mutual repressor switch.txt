Repressor switch
The TAL repressors were created by fusions of the KRAB repression domain to different positions relative tothe TAL DNA-binding domain and reporter plasmids with their respective binding sites (operators).
Repressors: (A) In the absence of a TAL repressor, the reporter gene is constitutively expressed. (B) When a TAL repressor is expressed, it binds to its respective DNA-binding site upstream of the CMV promoter and represses transcription of the reporter gene through KRAB domain-mediated transcriptional silencing Activators: In the absence of a TAL activator, there is no expression of the reporter gene. (B) When TAL activator is present, it binds to its DNA-binding site upstream of the minimal promoter and activates transcription of the reporter gene.
