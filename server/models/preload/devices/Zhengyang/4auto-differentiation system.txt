Auto-differentiation system 2012SEU_O_China
This system uses a toggle switch to save a status, which simulates the cell differentiation, a AHL generate-receive system for intercelluar communication, an antisense mRNA biobrick as cell division inhibitor, in order to control the shape of bacteria colony.
This system uses a toggle switch to save a status, which simulates the cell differentiation, a AHL generate-receive system for intercelluar communication, an antisense mRNA biobrick as cell division inhibitor, in order to control the shape of bacteria colony. We designed a cell movement control device to start the differentiation automatically, as well as a light sensor system to start it artificially for easier control and further application. Promoted by the lac promoter, AHL molecules are generated from those special cells.Receiving the AHL molecules, cells start their division inhibition system. An antisense mRNA is transcript, which can bind the mRNA of an essential cell division protein, FtsZ, and thus inhibit its expression and repress the growth of that part of colony. As a result, by controlling the position of light signal, we could create an unsymmetrical colony.
