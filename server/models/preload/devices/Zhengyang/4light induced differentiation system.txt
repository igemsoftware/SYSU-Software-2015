Light induced system 2012SEU_O_China
This system can be induced by light and produces lac.
At the beginning, all the cells are set on status 1 by exposure of UV light. Thus, the cI promoter is switched on and lacI protein is produced. So, at this time, the lac promoter is inhibited and the signal molecular is not generated. When a cell gets a light signal, the light sensor system will be triggered, and a small amount of cI protein will be produced, which can repress the cI promoter. Then, the toggle switch will be set to status 2, in which the lac promoter is active.
