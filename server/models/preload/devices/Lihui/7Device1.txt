Responsor-DOXYCYCLINE 2014UCSF_UCB
Using endogenous signaling pathways found in yeast, this device can interrogate cell-to-cell signaling, and collective response, in these organisms. Depending on the communication parameters ！ signal strength, receptor abundance, and signal degradation ！ researchers were able to tune the strength and output of these communicating cells.
