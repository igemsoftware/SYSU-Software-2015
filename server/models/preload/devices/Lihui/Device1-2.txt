Customer
The basic design of Customer¡¯s circuit is the same as Company. In the presence of 3OC12HSL, which represents the Product, Customer produces CmR and RhlI. CmR prevents the Customer from growth inhibition, and RhlI produces C4HSL, which represents Money. If there is not any Product in the market, Customer cannot produce CmR. This leads to the growth inhibition of Customer.
