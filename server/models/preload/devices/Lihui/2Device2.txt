The Kill-switch will reassure regulated expression by providing a stable expression of the fungal inhibitors that are activated only during exposure to fusaric acid. After exposure to fusaric acid the Kill-switch will have a stable expression of toxins that will kill the bacteria. This reassures that the bacterium removes itself when the threat of Fusarium oxysporum is gone. The designed Kill-switch system consists of two plasmids, an input/output plasmid and a toggle switch plasmid.
