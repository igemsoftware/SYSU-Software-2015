Company
In the presence of C4HSL, which represents Money, Company can produce chloramphenicol-resistance gene product (CmR) and LasI. CmR protects the Company from the antibiotic action of chloramphenicol. LasI produces signaling molecule 3OC12HSL, which represents the Product made by the Company. If there is not any C4HSL in the medium, Company cannot produce CmR. This will lead to the growth inhibition of the Company, which represents the Company¡¯s bankruptcy.
