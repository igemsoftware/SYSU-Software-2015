Biosensor-Detecting chlorinated solvents (DCM) 2014Oxford
This biosensor, based on the M. extorquens DM4 degradation pathway for DCM is designed to give a detectable fluorescent output that when integrated into an electronic circuit signals when there is very little to no DCM left in our DCMation kit.
