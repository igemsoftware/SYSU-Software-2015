When IPTG involved in, this device can relieve the repression from repressor LacI, therefore protein CheZ is produced to make the engineering bacteria (CL-1) regain motile ability. Within certain L-arabinose concentration range which means certain constraint condition, the more IPTG involved in, the more CheZ is produced leading to stronger motile ability.
