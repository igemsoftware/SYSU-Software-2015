Receptor 2014Colombia
This receptor can receive the signal of Cholera Auto-Inducer 1 (CAI-1).
It uses the same membrane receptor and transduction pathway in V. cholerae, explained above, to detect CAI-1 presence-absence. A phosphorylation cascade is activated in the absence of CAI-1, while a phosphatase reverse cascade is activated in the presence of the signal molecule. Phosphorylated LuxO activates the pqrr4 promoter region.
