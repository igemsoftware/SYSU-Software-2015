Kill switch 2013TU-Delft
The kill switch design is based on the expression of holin and antiholin. 
Holin is a protein that forms pores in cell membranes. Anti-holin binds to holin and inhibits its action. Once pores are formed by holin, lysozyme can access the periplasmic space and degrade the cell wall, causing cell lysis.
