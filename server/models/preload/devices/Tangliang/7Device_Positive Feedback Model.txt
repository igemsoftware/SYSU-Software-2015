Biosensor-Dinitrotoluene(DNT) 2007Glasgow
This device is a sensor of Dinitrotoluene(DNT). Ithas XylR and related promoters Pr and Pu to produce pyocyanin in the presence of toluene. 
Sensing part:The regulatory region consists of a putative LysR-type transcription factor (DntR) consisting of an N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal cofactor-binding domain, 301 amino acids in length (Johnson 2002) which recognises 2,4-DNT and positively regulates transcription of an operon encoding components of the 2,4-DNT dioxygenase complex. DntR also detects salicylate, an intermediate in the metabolic breakdown of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). These compounds are found as contaminants in the ground surrounding industrial factories that deal with petroleum derivatives.
