dCAS-VP16 system 2013Freiburg
The dCas9-VP16 fusion protein is guided to the desired DNA sequence by a co-expressed crRNA and tracrRNA. The binding of the gene recognition complex leads to an expression of SEAP.
This network includes four different components dCas9-VP16, a RNA complex (tracr/cr RNA), a RNA-dCas9-VP16 complex and the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP). The regulation is based on the RNA-guided Cas9 protein, which allows specific targeting of DNA sequences. The RNA-complex is bound to dCas9-VP16 and the resulting complex binds the DNA, which leads to the production of SEAP.
