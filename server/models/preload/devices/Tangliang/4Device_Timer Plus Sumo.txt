Timer Plus Sumo 2013TU-Delft
The structure of the timer has two repressing promoters (PcI and Ptet) and the input is the T7 promoter and the output is the protease Ulp-1. This Ulp-1 cleaves off the SUMO from the produced SUMO+peptide.
A translational timer was added to the total circuit in order to delay the peptide production. The timer gives the time for the peptide to build up in the cell non-toxically, before activation through cleavage.
