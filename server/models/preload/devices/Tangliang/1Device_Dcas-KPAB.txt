Dcas-KPAB system 2013Freiburg
The dCAS-KRAB fusion protein binds to the desired target sequence at a different locus than the tetR. tetR in turn binds to tetO and is assumed to repress SEAP production.
KRAB plays a key role in epigenetic silencing, by recruiting a scaffold of diverse proteins to the zinc fingers' binding site - amongst others histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferases. To date, KRAB domains were attached to several DNA binding proteins such as lacR and tetR, thereby silencing gene expression downstream of designed reporter targets.
