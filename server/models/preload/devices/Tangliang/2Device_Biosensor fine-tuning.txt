Biosensor-fine tuning 2013Peking
This device is a sensor of 2-HBP and 2-ABP. 2-HBP and 2-ABP can combine with the HbpR protein and activate it. Therefore, the promoter HbpR which is controlled by protein HbpR. And the promoter can be active and the downstream pathways are triggered.
A constitutive promoter (Pc) constitutively expresses the transcriptional regulator protein HbpR on the low-copy backbone pSB4K5, the cognate promoter of the transcriptional regulator (TF) controls the expression of the reporter gene, super-fold green fluorescent protein (sfGFP, a novel and robust GFP variant designed for in vivo measurement of protein expression levels), its backbone is high-copy pUC57.
