TmRNA-rescue sytem 2009SJTU-BioX-Shanghai
This device can provide the E.coli with the relB's assistant: tmRNA together with its cofactor smpB can enhance anti-toxic efficiency of relB, resulting in completely recovery from sleeping.
This device has tmRNA which is under the control of PBAD, which can be induced by L-arabinose. SmpB is a small protein, as well as the coeffector of tmRNA, assisting tmRNA to bind stalled ribosomes. Therefore, a constitutive promoter(PsmpB) is designed to express SmpB. The tmRNA system orchestrates three key biological functions: (1) recognition and rescue of ribosomes stalled on aberrant mRNAs, (2) disposal of the causative defective mRNAs, and (3) addition of a degradation tag to ribosome-associated protein fragments for directed proteolysis.
