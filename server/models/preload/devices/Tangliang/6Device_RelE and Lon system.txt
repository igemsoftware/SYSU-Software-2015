Production of toxin- RelE and lon system 2009SJTU-BioX-Shanghai
RelE and Lon are clustered in the same operon with a lac promoter. one coexpressed, relE toxin become Hypnos` Curse, causing dormancy in E.coli.
In this device, the expressions of Lon protease and relE toxin is under the regulation of Lac promoter. At first, LacI-inhibiting protein is continously expressed, thus blocks the transcription of Lon and relE. Once we use IPTG to induce the genetic circuit, the free LacI will be inactive, which eventually causes co-expression of relE and Lon.
