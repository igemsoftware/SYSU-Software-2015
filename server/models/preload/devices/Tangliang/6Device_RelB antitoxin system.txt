RelB antitoxin system 2009SJTU-BioX-Shanghai
This device can neutralize the toxic relE.
The growth of E.coli can be restored by coexpression of the cognate relB antitoxin, which can form a heterotetrameric (relB-relE)2 structure when binding with relE. Thus,this structure is too large to fit into the A site, so the toxic relE can be neutralized. The RelB-antitoxin is under control of Lamda CI promoter, which means we can use L-tryptophan to induce expression of RelB-antitoxin. The Lamda CI promoter can also be induced by high temperature.The RelB-antitoxin is under control of Lamda CI promoter, which means we can use L-tryptophan to induce expression of RelB-antitoxin.
