B1-1 0.9% NaCl (Also Known as Isotonic Solution), 10 mL
Introduction	
This solution is used for suspending cells to avoid early lysis by osmosis. Some laboratories use phosphate buffered saline (PBS) instead.
Components
NaCl;
ddH2O.
Procedure	Time	Notes
1. Check that the balance is calibrated	20s	An uncalibrated balance gives inaccurate results.
2. Calculate how much you need to weigh out of the compound for making a 10 mL solution.	30s	Every 10ml solution contains 0.09g NaCl.
3. Add the salt to a glass bottle and add water to dissolve.	30s	Solids should always be dissolved in a smaller volume of ddH2O than the final calculated volume.
4. Make up to the final volume of 10 mL.	10s
