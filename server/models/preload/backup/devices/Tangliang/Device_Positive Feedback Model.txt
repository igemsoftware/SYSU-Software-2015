¡¾1¡¿The positive feedback model includes additional coding region for TF protein placed after PhzMS coding. Once the pollutant is present and expression of reporter proteins is started also more TF is produced. Our assumption was that increased concentration of TF will cause more pollutant molecules to be bound into TF|S complex and, in turn, expression at the TF|S promoter would be enhanced further. The equations we have developed for the positive feedback loop model are as follows.
