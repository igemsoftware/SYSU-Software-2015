Part C
Without any exogenous stimulus, E. coli will produce background amount of AraC to repress pBAD at limit degree. That means even no L-arabinose involved in, promoter pBAD has leakage expression, so that part C will produce repressor LacI which can bind to the operon of promoter pLac and thus repress its transcription. Because L-arabinose could induce pBAD, within certain concentration range, the more L-arabinose involved in, the more repressor LacI part C could produce resulting the inhibition to chemotaxis. Because of its ability to constrain chemotaxis, this part is named C.
