targeting system
Such a system could have applications in a number of different fields, though we have chosen to put this into practice in a pinpointing pathogen-killing approach. In our prototype system, introduced inE. coli , we hijack the quorum sensing system of the gut pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica . Our bacteria will be able to sense the presence of the pathogen, accumulate in its vicinity and emit a target-specific bacteriocin, leaving the remaining gut flora intact. The era of mass destruction is over.
