Colombia
This year, iGEM Team Colombia has been hard at work developing of a biosensor for the human bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae. Our idea focuses on creating a easy-to-use kitcapable of detecting this bacterium in different contexts, such as different kinds offood or water, by giving a simple visible color signal as a positive result. This kit would be useful for anyone who wants to detect cholera-infected food and water without having to use the expensive or tedious methods now available, such as immunogenic techniques or direct isolation and culture of bacteria. Possible users are companies in the food industry and quality or research labs.
