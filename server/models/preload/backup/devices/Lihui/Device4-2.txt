Part M
When IPTG involved in, it can relieve the repression from repressor LacI, therefore protein CheZ is produced to make our engineering bacteria (CL-1) regain motile ability. Within certain L-arabinose concentration range which means certain constraint condition, the more IPTG involved in, the more CheZ is produced leading to stronger motile ability. Because of its ability to make CL-1 motile, this part is named M.
