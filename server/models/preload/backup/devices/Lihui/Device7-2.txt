community response
Cells in a local population have a wide range of responses to a given stimulus. This noisiness may be due to differences in extracelluar environment or intracellular molecular makeup. Yet these cells often need to coordinate and respond in a concerted way. Our project seeks to understand the complex intercellular interactions that must happen to produce such a specific community phenotype.
