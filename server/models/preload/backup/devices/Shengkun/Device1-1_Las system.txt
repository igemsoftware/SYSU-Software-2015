Northwestern2011-1
This construct was developed by Northwestern's 2011 iGEM team as part of a Pseudomonas Aeruginosa detector. The device is designed to fluoresce with GFP in the presence of PAI1 (3-oxo-C12-HSL), one of the Pseudomonas quorum sensing molecules. The promoter in front of GFP is activated by the combination of PAI1 from the environment and the LasR receptor (produced by this construct).
