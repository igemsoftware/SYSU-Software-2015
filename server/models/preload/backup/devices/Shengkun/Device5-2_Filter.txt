This module acts like a high pass amplitude filter for the toxic input substance, since it produces RFP only when the toxic substance concentration goes above a certain threshold. At high acetaldehyde concentrations, TetR is repressed, so the repression of CI by TetR can not be established. At high xylene concentrations, XylR is activated and it triggers CI expression.
