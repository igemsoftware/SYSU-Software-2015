Chemotaxis is the cells system for directed movement which allows the cell to move towards nutrition sources as well as away from toxic substances. Then, by producing CheZ under controlled manners, the bacteria would ideally become motile again but on our terms. The result would be low production of CheZ when close to the pathogen and high production when far away from it.
